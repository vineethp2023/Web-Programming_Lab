	<p>
	The HyperText Markup Language, or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. 
        It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
        Web browsers   receive  HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. 
        HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.

	  The scripting languages are also good means to make a website interactive and dynamic. Some of the scripting languages:
		<ul type="square">
			<li>Java Script</li>
			<li>PHP:PHP Hypertxt Preprocessor</li>
			<li>Python</li>
		</ul>
